## Events

It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation. War is hell." ~ Gen. William T. Sherman

Interesting article from 2014:

"Moreover, as Morgenthau said, if the alliance it to be operative, the Member States must agree not only about the general political orientation, but also on specific policies and measures. However, as can be clearly seen on the example of Russia, for many years NATO has been able to meet only the first condition, while at the level of specific actions there have been already significant differences."
